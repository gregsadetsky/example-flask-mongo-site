# Example Flask + Mongo Site

This example assumes that you've forked and deployed the separate [Disco Mongo code](https://github.com/letsdiscodev/example-mongo) as a separate Disco project.

Once that's done, you can use this Flask example to connect to that Mongo instance (using the internal domain name `mongo-mongo`).
